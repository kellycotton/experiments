## Online Memory Grant Experiment 3 (OMG3)
### Experiment created in PsychoPy to be run online and locally
#### Created by Kelly Cotton 02/03/2023


#### Basic experimental design:
* Working memory simple span task with letter stimuli, 2AFC recognition test.
	* For the letter recognition task: Right Arrow key = right letter, Left Arrow key = left letter
	* Letters are usually black but 75% of trials have one red letter
	* Two reward conditions: high reward (red letters are worth 25 points) and low reward (red letters are worth 3 points, the same as black letters)

#### Experimental Flow
1. Instructions and practice
	* Participants practice the working memory task. During both practice and experimental trials, participants are given feedback. To increase the number of:
		* working memory practice trials, change the number of loops in "practice_trials" 
2. Working memory trials
	* Currently set at XX total trials: XX blocks (can be changed with "block_total") * XX trials (can be changed with "trial_total")

Design based on Sandry, J. & Ricker, T. J. (2020). Prioritization within visual working memory reflects a flexible focus of attention. Attention Perception & Psychophysics, 82(6), 2985-3004.
