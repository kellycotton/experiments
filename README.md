# Experiments Repository
### Created by Kelly Cotton 4/11/23

Here is a collection of experiments that I've programmed and analysis scripts that I've written. Some of the experiments have their own explanatory READMEs, but others don't. Maybe some day in the future I will clean this code up!

A brief overview:

1. CategorySwitch
* Category switching task with two categories
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run online
* Experiment script only
* Includes README
* Dayalu, V., Hebert, K., Grabowski, C., Cotton, K., & Patel, S. (2022). Examining the Relationship Between Task-Switching and Speech Errors in Parkinson's Disease. *Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation*, 103(12), e188.

2. CategorySwitch_easy
* Easier version of CategorySwitch
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run online
* Experiment script only
* Includes README

3. Creativity
* SLTM task with added creativity tasks
* CM1 includes Remote Associates Test, CM2 includes Alternate Uses Test
* CM2 has two versions (A and B, differ only on word list used) and a secondary long-term test (CM2_A_2 and CM2_B_2)
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run online
* Experiment and analyses scripts
* Includes (brief) README
* Cotton, K., & Ricker, T. J. (2022). Is there a role of creativity in the relationship between working memory consolidation and long-term memory?. *Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics*, 1-16.

4. MDMW3
* Immediate recall and delayed recognition, verbal stimuli
* Immediate test includes simple, complex, and slow span conditions
* Includes go/no-go distractor task
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run online
* Experiment and analyses scripts
* Includes READMEs

5. Mind-Wandering
* Change detection task with mind-wandering probe
* MDMW2-4: Brown-Peterson design, MDMW4-1: complex span design
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run online
* Experiment and analyses scripts
* Includes README

6. OnlineMemory
* 3 experiments
* OMG1: Working memory complex span task with word stimuli, secondary parity judgment task, 2AFC recognition test, categorical mind-wandering prompt after each trial, go/no-go distractor task
* OMG2: Working memory Brown-Peterson task with colors/images continuous response recall, secondary parity judgment task, delayed continuous response recall test
* OMG3: Working memory simple span task with letter stimuli, 2AFC recognition test
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run online and in-person
* Experiment and analyses (omg1 and omg2) scripts
* Includes READMEs

7. SLTM
* Stimulus identification task, delayed 2AFC recognition task with confidence rating 
* Octave/Matlab
* No README
* Cotton, K., & Ricker, T. J. (2021). Working memory consolidation improves long-term memory recognition. *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition*, 47(2), 208.

8. Stress
* Working memory Brown-Peterson task with colored objects, delayed estimation task.
* SM1 is working memory only, SM2 includes WM/Perception task and delayed recall task
* SM2 also includes stress task
* Several questionnaires included in the experiment
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run in-person (SM1) and online (SM2)
* Experiment and analyses scripts
* Includes README (SM1)

9. WMB
* Several iterations of a working memory binding task
* PsychoPy/PsychoJS to be run in-person (SM1) and online (SM2)
* Experiment and analyses scripts
* Includes READMEs (see for more info on each experiment)
